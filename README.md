# Tactical Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty Estimation


## Code

Once published, this repo will contain the code that was used in the paper "Tactical Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving by Reinforcement Learning with Uncertainty Estimation".


## Videos

This section shows how the trained ensemble RPF and DQN agents perform in a few testing episodes within the training distribution, and in situations that are outside of the training distribution.
